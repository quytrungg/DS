    "The exercise will be completed directly from this notebook file. First, fill in the file header above with your name and student ID. You fill out the assignment in the notebook file where the given task starts with these patterns below: \n",
    "for required parts to implement\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# YOUR CODE HERE\n",
    "raise NotImplementedError()\n",
    "```\n",
    "or for optional parts:\n",

    "```\n",
    "or for markdown cell:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "YOUR ANSWER HERE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, when doing the lab, you just need to remove the line `raise NotImplementedError()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will typically be a cell (or several cells) with test suites to let you determine if the code is correct or not directly below the areas that require code that you need to implement; If there are no errors in this cell, the tests were successful.\n",
    "In some circumstances, test suites may be insufficient, meaning that even if the test passes but the code fails, it may not necessarily be correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can print on the screen as you work in the lab to generate more test cells. However, you can either erase the cells you make or add a comment to the statements that are displayed on the screen when you submit. <font color=red>Please be aware that you are not permitted to remove cells or change the coding of the teacher/assistant/lab instructor by yourselves (except where editing is allowed as mentioned above). </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to keep the code organized and clear; name proposed variables, add comments when necessary, and limit the length of each line of code (because otherwise the reader will have to scroll). Use this guideline if needed: a line of code should not exceed 79 characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is advised to frequently press CTRL + S while performing the workouts to save your work and prevent data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Keep in mind that <font color=green>knowledge and honest learning are the major objectives here</font>. Thoughts can be discussed, the work and <font color=green>code should be original to you and reflect your actual understanding</font>. <font color=red>Violations will result in a total course grade of zero.</font>*\n",
    "\n",
    "Other advice includes:\n",
    "- Starting early and not waiting until the last minute\n",
    "- Proceed with caution and gentleness. Coding in a very slow, but also very fast, manner. \n",
    "- Avoid sources of interference, such as social networks, games, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions for submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will be graded by selecting `Kernel-Restart & Run All` to restart and run every cell in your notebook while grading. As a result, you should test run `Kernel-Restart` & `Run All` before submitting your work to ensure everything is working as it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you create a submission folder with the following structure:\n",
    "- The `StudentID` folder (e.g., if you have an student ID of 1234567, name the folder 1234567):\n",
    "  - File `Homework_2.ipynb` (no need to submit other files)\n",

    "As a result, we can recommend a movie with a high prediction score to the first user. You will collaborate with all users in this assignment. However, you will not use loops and do it one by one for each user because Numpy dislikes loops (<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">specifically, Python's loops are very slow, so we should use NumPy to speed up the computation there</span>). Instead, you will do it all at once for all users. To do this, calculate the rating for all movies for each user; if you only score for movies that have not been scored, it will be difficult to do it for all users at the same time because each user will have a different number of movies that have not been scored. Scoring for movies that already have points is redundant (the recalculated score will be very close to the original score because the original score has the most weight), but it may help speed things up because we can do it with all users at once.\n",

    "If you try it, you'll discover that you can't do it with all users at once because the intermediate result arrays will be about number of users $\\times$ number of users $\\times$ number of movies, and <span style=\"color:red\">there won't be enough memory</span>. One way to avoid having to browse each user again is to browse a group of users at once (called a batch) and predict their scores; the size of the intermediate result arrays will be reduced to about the number of users-of-a-batch $\\times$ number of users $\\times$ number of movies. So, in this case, you will be able to browse each batch using the loop (group of users).\n",

Finally, you'll fill the array `filled_ratings` with all of the movie scores; We only interested in the fill values that correspond to the nan values in the original `ratings` array (you can give other values anyway). Take care not to change the `ratings` array during the process."

As a result, you will first attempt this with a batch. I'll help you by breaking it down into steps and providing you with a test suite for each one. When switching from working with a single user to working with a batch size user, keep in mind that arrays will have an extra dimension at the top with the `batch_size` corresponding to the `batch_size` user.
